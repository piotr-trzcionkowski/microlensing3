# microlensing3

01/2021

Main purpose of the script is to fit photometric data to Microlesning Model with parallax.

Script was developed through Google Colab where every file that here is seperate (parsubs and ulens_functions) was in the main file, so the functions here and in ulens_functions probably require parsubs. and ulens_functions. to be addedto be added to work properly.

1st part plots parallax microlensing curve over standard Paczynski microlensing curve to show the differences in those and how subtle they can be

2nd part is for input data to which curve will be fitted with least squares method

3rd part is loading data, preparing them for fitting, plotting data points

4th part is fitting the data using parallax microlensing model and plotting the resulting curve over the data points
